        <h3>Logistic Regression Analysis</h3>
        I pulled the price data for LCID stock since going public, 
        and aggregated the data such that each experimental unit had 
        a response variable of closing price of LCID on each day, and
        predictor variables were closing price on each of the 5 days 
        preceding the current day.
