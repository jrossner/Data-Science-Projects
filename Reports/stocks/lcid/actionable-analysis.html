        <h3>Logistic Regression Analysis</h3>
        I pulled the price data for LCID stock since going public, 
        and aggregated the data such that each experimental unit had 
        a response variable of closing price of LCID on each day, and
        predictor variables were closing price on each of the 5 days 
        preceding the current day.
      
        I then implemented a binary coding of each variable:
        <ul>
          <li> 0 - meaning the price of that day is lower than the previous day </li>
          <li> 1 - meaning the price of that day is higher than the previous day </li>
        </ul>
        
        My final logistic model thus had 4 predictors & 1 response variable
      
        I found the model had a <b>58% True Negative Accuracy</b> on both the training data
        and the entire dataset. However, the model poorly predicted Positives. 
        
        <b> If one were to make decisions based on this model, a Negative prediction is certainly 
          more confident than a Positive prediction. </b> Perhaps shorting the stock on such predictions is the play.
